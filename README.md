## About this project

The goal of this project is to create a dashboard that displays the overall sales figures and performance of the fictional coffee shop *I Need My Beans!* to the owners.

- the best-selling menu items by transactions


**Data Source**:<br>
The data used is fictional and sourced from *Maven Analytics*. It contains order details of all transactions recorded from January to June 2023.
